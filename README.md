## Installation 

**READ ALL**

Should work for Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS, etc. Let me know if there's any issues

This is mainly intended for a clean installation. If you already have a desktop configuration I recommend to implement manually.

Existing configuration files that are being replaced will be backed up automatically.

**First install git then use the next command and continue the installation until it's finished:**

```bash

sudo pacman -S git   
```
```bash

git clone https://github.com/43PR/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Open GTX Settings and change Color scheme to Prefer dark - Apply.

After the installation finishes log out and back in.

> [!note]
> 
> Waybar custom-gpu is specific to my PC so you can remove it or implement.
>
> If you’re having any issues with the wallpaper picker, you can clear the cache from the Storage page in Settings.
