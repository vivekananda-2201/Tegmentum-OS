## Windows Customization

A collection of the customizations, tools, configs, and tweaks I use to customize Windows.

You can copy the configuration files for YASB and Komorebi directly from this repository.

Note: The Komorebi configuration is still rough and may contain bugs or unfinished parts. Feel free to skip that section if you just want the other customizations.

Open Terminal/PowerShell with administrator privileges when required by the installer.

YASB — Custom status bar

Komorebi — Tiling window manager configuration

WHKD — Keyboard shortcuts for Komorebi

Spicetify — Spotify customization

Wallpaper picker — Python-based wallpaper tool

Forgot to try but you can use PowerShell with Everforest
(color scheme with focus mode to remove title bar and acrylic
enabled)

### Cava

Install Cava using WinGet Run:
```bash

winget install karlstav.cava 
```
reload

```bash

cava
```

### Btop

Install btop:

```bash

winget install --id aristocratos.btop4win -e
```

reload

```bash

btop
```


### YASB status bar

To download this repository go to dotfiles > Code > Download zip

Install YASB with WinGet:

```bash

winget install --id AmN.yasb
```

After installing:

Open YASB.
Select Get Started.

Choose the components/features you want.

The location should be:

C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.config\yasb\config.yaml

You can bookmark this location.

Edit the configuration with: VSCodium, Notepad or any other text editor 

Or download this repo (dotfiles > Code > download zip) and copy the yasb folder

Autostart

Enable Auto Start from the YASB taskbar tray icon.

You can also reload the YASB bar from the same tray menu after editing the files.


### Wallpaper Picker

The wallpaper picker requires Python and Pillow.

Install from

https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Open installer > Enable Add python.exe to PATH  > Install


Open a terminal and run:

```bash

pip install Pillow
```

Create a folder named "Wallpapers" inside Pictures and add your wallpapers

You can download this repository and copy paste this yasb folder to C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.config\

Whenever you add, remove, or change wallpapers, run the cache script again:

```bash

python $env:USERPROFILE\.config\yasb\scripts\wallpaper_thumb_cache.py
```

Reload yasb. If it doesn't work, make sure the folder is in the correct location and that the username/path matches your Windows installation.

Remove the ps1 file from "scripts" folder if you only use 1 workspace. It restarts the file explorer 



### Spicetify

Theme: text by darkthemer (edited)

Installation. Run the following command in PowerShell:

```bash

iwr -useb
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The default Spicetify directory should be:

C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Local\spicetify

Open a terminal without administrator privileges and run:

```bash

spicetify backup apply
```

Close Spotify completely.

Replace the corresponding files with the ones from the repository.

https://github.com/43PR/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/spicetify/Themes/text

Make sure the theme folder is named: text

Then run:

```bash

spicetify apply
```

If something goes wrong and you want to return to the original Spotify setup:

```bash

spicetify restore backup
```



### Komorebi + WHKD

The Komorebi configuration is still a work in progress and may have bugs or require additional adjustments. If you don't need a tiling window manager, I recommend skipping this section.

Install Komorebi

```bash

winget install --id LGUG2Z.komorebi
```

Install WHKD

WHKD handles the keyboard shortcuts:

```bash

winget install --id LGUG2Z.whkd
```

Start Komorebi

Run:

```bash

komorebic start
```

Create the WHKD Configuration

Create the configuration file:

```bash

New-Item -ItemType File -Force "$HOME\.config\whkdrc"
```


Open it with Notepad:

```bash

notepad "$HOME\.config\whkdrc"
```

Copy the appropriate configuration into the file and save it.

Then start WHKD:

```bash

whkd
```

Create the configuration file:

```bash

notepad "$HOME\.config\komorebi.json"
```

The Komorebi configuration is also included in this repository.

Set the Komorebi Config Path

For the current PowerShell session:

```bash

$env:KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME = "C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.config"
```

To permanently set it for your user account:

Replace <YOUR_USERNAME> with your Windows username.

```bash

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME",
    "C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.config",
    "User"
)
```

Start Komorebi With the Config

```bash

komorebi --config "C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.config\komorebi.json"
```

Enable movement animations:

```bash

komorebic animation enable --animation-type movement
```

Other commands:

komorebic stop
komorebi --config "C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.config\komorebi.json"
komorebic start



Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work, check the following first:

Make sure paths use your actual Windows username instead of <YOUR_USERNAME>.

Make sure configuration files are inside the correct .config directory.
Restart YASB after modifying its configuration.

Make sure Spotify is completely closed before replacing Spicetify files.

Run Spicetify commands without administrator privileges unless specifically required.

If Komorebi behaves unexpectedly, remember that its configuration is still a work in progress.
